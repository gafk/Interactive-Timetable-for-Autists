## Interactive Timetable For Children With Autistic Spectrum Disorders ##

#### What is the "Interactive Timetable For Children With Autistic Spectrum Disorders"? ####

* This is the application that Volgograd State Technical University develop alongside with the rehabilitation center called «Nadezhda» 
for their children who have all sorts of autistic spectrum disorders. 

* The app will help children to visualize their every day activities, to see it whenever they need and to intuitively interact with it.

* Meanwhile the app will help the staff of the center to store all the children related data they need: their names, 
their hospital trips, diagnostics, etc.

#### Technologies we use ####
* We use C# in combination with Xamarin to create a cross-platform business model that we can use 
for any platform such as Android, iOS, Windows and Mac.

* For now we’re only implementing the UI for wide-screen Android device using Xamarin.Android.

* For storing all the application data we use fast and light-weight SQLite database engine.
